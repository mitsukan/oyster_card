# Week 2: Oystercard

### Day 1: Dan Tooke and Jihin

#### Challenge 1: Creating a Gemfile

What is a Gemfile?

We create this in our repo to specify where the ruby gems are made, and what we require.

Specified gem source.

Specified ruby version.

Added rspec to test and development groups.

We also included simple coverage gem.


#### Challenge 2: Create RSpec conventional files

We ran `rspec --init` to create the conventional files. We then made the `lib` directory and `touch`ed a file. We created a `describe` block in the `oystercard_spec.rb` file.

#### Challenge 3: Review debugging process
